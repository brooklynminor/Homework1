01-HTML-Homework1
The purpose of this assignment was to apply our knowledge learned in lecture and implement such into our studies.
The following HTML Homework1 was fabricated and modified in Visual Code. Two links are required to
be submitted to Bootcamp Spot after the necessary modifications have been made.
The modifications made consisted of:
  1. Editing <div></div> to a higher suited title, such as: <header></header>, <article></article>, <section></section>, <footer></footer>.
  2. Fixing frozen image tags.
  3. Cleaning the code, allowing it to be easier to read and comprehend.
  4. Adding alt attribute tags to describe the image displayed.
Changes that were made within index.html had also been applied to style.css for the website to run corrections.
After saving the changes made, from Gitbash:
  1. git repo
  2. git add
  3. git commit -m “modifications made”
  4. git push
The first URL is to be deployed from the live website. The second is to be extracted from Github pages.
To retrieve the links, the following steps must occur:
  1. Create Repo (ie, Homework1)
  2. Get HTTP:// link from Github
  // Open Gitbash from (Bootcamp/Homework/Homework1)
  3. From terminal type:
    i. ls
    ii. git clone – following the HTTP:// link from Github
    iii. cd homework
    iv. pwd
